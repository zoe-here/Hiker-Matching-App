* [ ] The email address is not returned in API calls for other users.
* [ ] The user can specify a location from a list.
* [ ] The user only sees recommendations from their location.
* [ ] The user can see a list of no more than 10 recommendations at a time.
* [ ] The recommendations are prioritized with the best first.
* [ ] The recommendations behave in line with the student's described matching logic.
* [ ] It is possible to dismiss a recommendation.
    * [ ] That recommendation is not shown again after it is dismissed.
* [ ] Connection requests can be sent.
* [ ] Incoming connection requests can be rejected.
* [ ] Incoming connection requests can be accepted.
* [ ] Users can only see profile information when properly allowed.
    * [ ] They are recommended.
    * [ ] There is an outstanding connection request.
    * [ ] They are connected.
* [ ] It is possible to disconnect with a user.
* [ ] Chat is only possible between connected profiles.
* [ ] Chats are ordered with the most recently active chat first.
* [ ] Chat messages feature a date and time.
* [ ] A chat history can be reached from the connected user's profile.
* [ ] Both users see the same chat history.
* [ ] The chat history API data is paginated.
* [ ] The chat works in real time.
* [ ] An unread message icon appears when new chat messages are received in real time.
* [ ] The realtime implementation does not rely on polling.
* [ ] The recommendations endpoint only returns a list of ids.
